Additional notes:
- The inline-metadata at the top of each script allows `uv` to run the script without a local installation of python or virtual-environments or dependency-packages.

- Dependencies are _also_ listed in the `pyproject.toml` file to run tests easily.

- The `pyproject.toml` file contains some project guidelines for LLM-helpers to follow when generating code. I wanted to put this somewhere unobtrusive. Windsurf's `GPT-5 (low-reasoning)` does a good job following these.
